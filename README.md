## ❓ FAQ (OPTIONAL) <a name="faq"></a>

> Add at least 2 questions new developers would ask when they decide to use your project.

- **How can I add new cars to the CarHub Project with prices?**

  - As an admin user, you can easily add new cars to the CarHub Project by accessing the admin dashboard. From there, you can select the "Add Car" option and fill out the necessary details, including the car's make, model, year, and rental price. Once you save the changes, the new car will be added to the list of available cars for users to reserve.

- **How can users reserve cars on the CarHub Project?**

  - To reserve a car on the CarHub Project, users must first sign up or log in to their account. Once logged in, they can browse the available cars and select the one they want to reserve. They can then choose the rental dates and confirm their reservation. The system will automatically calculate the total rental price based on the selected dates and display it for the user to confirm. Once confirmed, the user's reservation will be saved in the system, and they can pick up the car on the designated rental dates.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
